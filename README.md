# DDT_Framework
This is a **Data Driven** Testing (**DDT**) TestNG Framework
- based on Page Object Model (POM) Pattern Design. 
- _I developed this framework from scratch and some tools I used are:_
- **Java** as main language,
- **Selenium** as automation,
- **TestNG** for assertion and running tests,
- **XML files** for running tests such as **regression** and **smoke** tests,
- **Extent Reports** plugin for generating **_beautiful reports_** after each test,
- **Maven** as an automation tool management used for dependency management using **Project Object Model** (pom.xml),
- **.properties files** for reading and retrieving test data from the config package,
- **Excel utility** function for reading and writing data to and from spreadsheets,
- and many more...
